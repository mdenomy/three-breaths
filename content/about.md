## Welcome

My name is Michael Denomy and I am a software developer originally from the Boston area, now living the remote life from Cape Cod. Welcome to my blog.

I have been developing software professionally for over 25 years, working in a variety of fields from web development to medical devices and a lot of things in between. More than any particular languages, tools, or technologies, I am driven by ways that teams can collaborate to make robust, high-quality software.

I identify as a software developer, but these days I spend my professional life managing teams and loving it. My passion is around helping folks get to the next level, whatever that may be.

You can contact me by leaving a comment below or reach me at mdenomy on twitter and gmail.

## Why Three Breaths

Three breaths is a meditation technique to help center yourself. It's as simple as taking three deep breaths. There are lots of flavors and variations, feel free to google around if you are curious.

Meditation and mindfulness techniques have been a huge help to me, especially against the daily struggles of working in the high tech space and just navigating life in general. I've found the [MBSR program](https://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/mindfulness-based-programs/mbsr-courses/) out of UMass Med school and online to be really helpful for me.

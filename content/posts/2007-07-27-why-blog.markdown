A developer on my team once asked an excellent question: "Are you always looking for better ways to do things?"  Absolutely.   That's what I hope this blog is all about.

I used to know everything but that was a long time ago.  I've seen a lot of changes in the industry over the years in terms of tools and methodologies.

I care a lot about writing high quality software, on time, with the right feature set, and I hope be able to use this blog as a forum to capture things that went right, things that went wrong, and exchange ideas with other developers.

I have a secret.  A horrible, terrible secret.

I can't type to save my life.  I've been writing software for over 20 years and have managed to get by with hunting and pecking with 3-4 fingers.  And that worked fine, working alone in my little cubicle...until pair programming came into my existence.

I love [pairing](http://mdenomy.wordpress.com/category/pair-programming/).  The back-and-forth flow of ideas, the continuous discovery and refactoring, the changing roles between driver and navigator. I think it is one of the greatest improvements in how software engineers work that I've seen over my career.  But it sure helps to be able to type.

So I am going to do something about it.  Inspired by an old Corey Haines [post ](http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/2010/07/learn-to-type-week.html)I am declaring my own personal Learn to Type week.  Corey's post has some good links to help you improve your typing skills.  This [post ](http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/2009/08/5-places-to-learn-how-to-touch-type-for-free.html)had a few more.

So for 30 minutes a day for the next week I am going to try and bring my typing skills up to a respectable, pairing-worthy level.  I'll keep you posted.



_**Update: **_After a week, I have to say it is slow going.  I have been doing exercises from this [post](http://www.typing-lessons.org/), and although I like the lessons a lot I am struggling to complete the lessons in 60 seconds.  At times I fly, error-free, then I think about how well I am doing, then I start to think about what keys are where, and then everything goes hay-wire.

This will take more than a week to learn, but I am committed to seeing it through.  Right now I am still much faster with my 3-fingered typing, but if I stick with it I think it will pay off in the end.

There is a new startup accelerator looking to set up shop in Boston this summer.  The thing that caught my eye is that this accelerator, [Bolt](http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2012/02/bolt_new_accelerator_program_f.html), will focus on connected devices.  Real...physical...stuff.

I think that this is great for the Boston area.  We already have a lot of energy and effort in the area around startups for mobile, web, and software services, but I think this will help bring other engineering disciplines into the Boston startup community.  The ability to iterate in the mechanical/electrical world has improved a lot over the years, especially with the widespread use of [3D printers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing), [electronics prototyping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype#Electronics_prototyping), and OTS platforms like [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/).  It will be interesting to see how [lean startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) principles come into play in the physical world (yes, I know that's where they came from [initially](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing))

As someone who has spent most of his career doing software for robotics, automation, and medical devices this will be something to keep an eye on.

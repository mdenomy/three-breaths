I gave a talk recently at the June 2013 BostonMotion meetup.  The idea behind the talk was to capture my experiences coming up to speed on [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/), from the perspective of a developer who knows Ruby on Rails but hasn't had much, if any, experience with iOS.

Nothing like having a hard deadline to force you to come up to speed on a project.  I learned a ton about [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/), [ProMotion](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion), [Formotion](https://github.com/clayallsopp/formotion), [MotionModel](https://github.com/sxross/MotionModel), [BubbleWrap](http://bubblewrap.io/), [Teacup](https://github.com/rubymotion/teacup), [Sugarcube](https://github.com/rubymotion/sugarcube), and [MotionAwesome](https://github.com/derailed/motion-awesome)

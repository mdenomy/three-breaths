Microsoft is offering a free, two-hour online [workshop ](http://blogs.msdn.com/mpneast/archive/2010/04/22/register-to-attend-a-windows-azure-virtual-hands-on-workshop.aspx)for developing apps for [Windows Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/).  The course includes a full access Azure account for 2 weeks.  Seems like a good opportunity to learn how to develop apps for Microsoft's cloud platform.

If you are in the Boston area, there is also a one-day event on May 8th at Microsoft NERD called [Boston Azure Firestarter](http://microsoftcambridge.com/Events/BostonAzureFirestarter/tabid/381/Default.aspx).  The event will feature classes and labs on developing for the Azure platform.

You will need to have Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010 installed, as well as the Azure Tools for Visual Studio.

I am now a month into the [ Season of Ruby](http://mdenomy.wordpress.com/category/season-of-ruby/), so aside from the usual retrospective, it is a good time to reflect on what I have learned to this point.  In the last month I have made the following strides:



	  * Set up a [github account](https://github.com/mdenomy) and pushed code up to it.
	  * Re-familiarized myself with[ git](http://git-scm.com/) and got more practice using it on a day-to-day basis, creating and merging branches, as well as pushing code to github and [heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).
	  * Learning the basics of Ruby and used it to develop an implementation of the [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/mdenomy/GameOfLife)
	  * Picked up a little Rails with the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://mdenomy.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/halftime-review-of-michael-hartls-ruby-on-rails-tutorial/)

**What Went Well**



	  * I am really enjoying the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://mdenomy.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/halftime-review-of-michael-hartls-ruby-on-rails-tutorial/), not just for how it teaches Rails, but as much for the developer practices that it encourages.
	  * Gave some thought to the overall roadmap of where I want to go for the next few months.  I thought this [website](http://techiferous.com/2010/07/roadmap-for-learning-rails/) gave a good picture and though I will customize it a bit, I think a lot of the areas I want to build on are covered here.  For me the areas that I want to focus on in the next few months are a strong foundation in Ruby along with a better understanding of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) (and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)), and [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).  I have a few ideas about an app I can put together that will provide an opportunity to strengthen those areas.

**What Can Be Improved On**



	  * Practice, practice, practice.  The tutorial is really helping me put all this together, but I need to keep repeating the lessons to make sure it sinks in.  Similar to what I went through with the Ruby Koans, I don't want to develop a false sense of understanding, so I need to keep writing code and making sure to dig beneath the surface.



**What Am I Going To Do To Improve Things**






To make sure I am really grokking the lessons from the tutorial, I think it would be a good idea to take a few hours at the end of this iteration and write a simple app.  Something similar in complexity to the micro-blogging example in the tutorial. It doesn't need to be a complete application, but the parts I get to need to be "right", so I will time-box it at 3 hours. Does not need to be visually pretty.

**Iteration 4 Stories/Tasks**

Keep chugging away on the Ruby on Rails tutorial.  I am through chapter 5, but this is going to be a long week at work, so I would like to be able to get through chapters 6 & 7 this week.


To make sure I am really absorbing the tutorial lessons, develop a simple application without referring back to the tutorial documentation.  Going through other documentation is OK, e.g. StackOverflow, Ruby Core Docs, Rails Guides.  Time-box it at 3 hours, and follow good developer practices, i.e. use TDD, git/github.  Application is TBD, but should be similar in complexity to the micro-blogging example.

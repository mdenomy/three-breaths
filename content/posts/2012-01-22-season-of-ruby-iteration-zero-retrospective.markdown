Keeping in the Agile spirit, I did a [retrospective ](http://mdenomy.wordpress.com/2008/10/02/project-retrospective/)for Iteration Zero of my [Season of Ruby](http://mdenomy.wordpress.com/category/season-of-ruby/).  When I conduct a retrospective I cover 3 areas:



	  1. What did we do well
	  2. What can we improve on
	  3. What are we going to focus on in the next iteration to improve the process or the product

I am a team of 1 on this journey, so "we" is me.

**What Went Well**



	  * Digging the Ruby Koans** - **I'm happy that I am not just blowing through them to get to the next subject, but asking questions when something doesn't make sense or surprises me.  I also find myself adding additional tests to experiment with behaviors
	  * Love playing around in the IRB  -  This also has a lot to do with experimenting and following where my curiosity takes me.
	  * Got a Ruby environment set - OK, so it is not the shiny new Mac I wanted, but RubyMine on my Windows laptop has been a very low-friction experience.  The Mac will come.  I have a birthday coming up and maybe I will be good to me.

**What Can Be Improved On**



	  * Not writing enough code** - **Although I am _learning_ with the Ruby Koans, I am not _writing_ enough code.
	  * Making really good progress, but need to dedicate more time - I'm happy with where I am, but the time goes by quickly.  May need to dedicate just a little more time on a weekly basis.
	  * Haven't done anything with github yet - One of the goals was to set up a github account.  Technically I have satisfied that criteria because I have an account...an empty account.  That needs to change





**What Am I Going To Do To Improve Things**

As a rule, I usually only like to pick one thing to improve on, especially in a short iteration, but since these two things go so well together:







	  * Do the [String kata](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/) in Ruby - It's a pretty straightforward problem, one that I have done in C# and C++, and this will get me actually writing code
	  * Put the String kata in github, committing as new functionality is added.



**Iteration 1 Stories**








	  * Continue with the Ruby Koans, doing these exercises

	    * 'about_methods'
	    * 'about_constants'
	    * 'about_control_statements'
	    * 'about_true_and_false'
	    * 'about_triangle_project'
	    * 'about_exceptions'


	  * Do the String kata in Ruby in a github repo

I had an awesome day speaking to the students at [Launch Academy](http://www.launchacademy.com/) in Boston.  I have a lot of respect for what Dan Pickett and Evan Charles are doing over there, and I hope it brings a lot of new, great developers into the community.

I had initially planned on doing a talk on the [SOLID design principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod), but as the group is just starting out learning good practices, I didn't want to throw too much at them at once, so we focused on Single Responsibility Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle, and an Agile design practice called [Incremental Design](http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/incremental_design.html).

It was a ton of fun.  They are such an energetic and engaged group.  They had very good questions about technical debt, what constitutes a good test suite, and resources for further learning on TDD.

The talk is available below, although due to some technical difficulties at the talk I had to re-record it, so I didn't get their questions or the wild applause at the end ;)

Thank you Launchers for hosting me, and I look forward to seeing more of you in the Boston developer community.

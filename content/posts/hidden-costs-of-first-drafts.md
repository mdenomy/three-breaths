"Share early and often" is a message I've been sharing with my team lately. I mean a lot. A whole lot. In a perfect world, meritocracy prevails, egos are Teflon-coated, feedback is carefully thought out and clearly described. What could possibly be wrong with that.

So, back to the real world.

People, and corporations (TBD is that redundant, Mitt) generally want to do the right thing. We generally try to respect people, we generally want the best ideas to come to the front.

But people are messy, and even on the best of teams, behaviors and actions don't always align with ideals. So yeah, we are residents of the real world.

A certain amount of discomfort is natural with first drafts and putting new ideas out there. It's usually easier to find what's wrong rather than thinking up a solution. So you take a few dings when you put out a first draft. It builds character :)

Where it gets insidious is when that load isn't distributed around the team. When it becomes the role of one or two people to be the glue (link to Tanya Reilly), that's when the character building dings start to take a cumulative toll.

So I think "share early and often" is a message that I will continue to advocate, but I also need to be mindful of my role as a manager to observe and understand the dynamics in play, how the load is distributed, and work to put better systems in place

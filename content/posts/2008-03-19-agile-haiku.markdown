Inspired by James Shore's recent [Energized Work](http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/energized_work.html) haiku (and feeling temporarily brainlocked) I decided to tap my inner muse


<blockquote>_Commented out code!_ __

_Detritus of method's past_

_Time to refactor _</blockquote>


I know.....don't give up the day job. And give me a break, I know refactoring is a lot more than removing commented out code, but there is only so much you can say in 5-7-5 syllables.

Plus, I really wanted to work in [detritus](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/detritus).  Not a word you get to use everyday.

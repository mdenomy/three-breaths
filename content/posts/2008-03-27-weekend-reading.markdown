I went away for a relaxing weekend, far from cell phone reception and internet access.  Given my [recent post](http://mdenomy.wordpress.com/2008/03/27/energized-work-and-personal-responsibility/) about not being able to turn it off at the end of the day, maybe it is slightly ironic that I packed two books: [The Art of Agile Development](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/) and [The Art of War](http://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Sun-Tzu/dp/0670031569).

The Art of War is one of those books I like to pick up from time to time.  I am not a fan of comparing war to sports or work, there is no comparison.  The book is a good read though for understanding strategy, how to utilize resources, and human interactions.  Many of the concepts are applicable to daily life.

I found an interesting passage in The Art of War that could be applied to the concept of Energized Work.


<blockquote>_In War,
Victory should be swift
If victory is slow,
Men tire, morale sags
Sieges exhaust strength;
Protracted campaigns
Strain the public treasury.

If men are tired,
Morale low,
Strength exhausted,
Treasure Spent;
Then the feudal lords
Will exploit the disarray
And attack.
This even the wisest
Will be powerless
To mend.
_</blockquote>

I gave my first big crowd (to me anyway) talk at the [August Boston Ruby Meetup](http://bostonrb.org/presentations/month/August-2013).  It was a ton of fun, lots of 1st time speakers, with some really good content.  The highlight of the night was a satirical, musical tribute to Rails by Liana Leahy to the tune of "I Will Survive" that was an absolute home run.  There was also a talk on Imposter Syndrome that was particularly fitting since so many people were willing to step out of their comfort zone.

I did a condensed version of the talk I gave back in June at the BostonMotion meetup, so if you want the Cliff Notes version of that talk, here it is.

I have recently been pointed to a great blog called [Startup Lessons Learned](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/).  There are some great posts on product development, Agile practices, hiring practices and tips, and TDD, some of which have made me rethink how I go about my day and the practices I employ.  I highly recommend giving it a look.

There were a couple of posts on a practice called the Five Whys, which comes out of [Taiichi Ohno's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiichi_Ohno) book [Toyota Production System](http://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Production-System-Beyond-Large-Scale/dp/0915299143/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1265383836&sr=1-1).  The [first post](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/five-whys.html) is about the Five Whys and what they are meant to accomplish, and the [second](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/07/how-to-conduct-five-whys-root-cause.html) is on how to actually run a Five Why's analysis meeting. 

I am very eager to start applying this technique.  I am fortunate enough to be working on a really great team that has the maturity to avoid turning the five whys into a blame game.  I am sure it will take some practice, but I am interested to see what comes out of it.  If anyone has used this technique and has advice or stories to share I would like to hear them.

I'll let you know how it goes.
